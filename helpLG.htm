        <p>
            The <b>Executive Dashboard</b> application is used by local government leaders to
            proactively view critical metrics, identify trends, raise questions, and devise
            new management strategies. It supports community-wide efforts to increase accountability
            and transparency within government and with the citizens they serve. The Dashboard
            is a single application that can be deployed by local governments and used by decision-makers
            on a tablet device and desktop PC.</p>
        <h4>
            <u>Using the Application</u>
        </h4>
        <p>
            The Dashboard can be used to view performance across an entire community, or in
            a specific neighborhood youâ€™re interested in. Once a user logs-in to the Executive
            Dashboard, they are able to search for a specific address, bookmark areas of interest,
            review key reporting layers, and share notes or concerns with other management staff.<br />
        </p>
        <h4>
            <u>Finding an Area of Interest</u>
        </h4>
        <p>
            There are four primary ways to identify an area of interest. You can interact directly
            with the map, use your current location, or search for an address. Once you've found
            an area of interest, you can bookmark it so you can return to the same location
            at a later date.</p>
        <h4>
            <u>Map Based Navigation (On a Touch Screen Device)</u>
        </h4>
        <p>
            To interact with the map, you can:<br />
            <br />
            1. Pinch to zoom in/out<br />
            2. Tap the zoom in/out button<br />
            <h4>
                <u>Searching</u>
            </h4>
            <p>
                The Search button can be used to find an address you're interested in:<br />
                <br />
                1. Tap the Search button<br>
                2. Enter the address you're interested in and tap the search icon<br>
                3. Tap on the item in the list to locate the address on the map<br />
                <br />
                You can enter a partial address and then identify the correct value in the list.</p>
        <h4>
            <u>Bookmarks</u>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Once you've found an address or location you're interested in:<br />
            <br />
            1. Tap the Bookmarks button<br>
            2. Enter the name of the bookmark<br />
            3. Tap the Add button<br />
            <br />
            You can also remove one more bookmarks from the list when you no longer need it.</p>
        <h4>
            <u>Notes</u>
        </h4>
        <p>
            The Note button can be used to place notes, or comments on the map:<br />
            <br />
            1. Tap the Note button<br>
            2. Tap on a location on the map to place your note<br />
            3. Enter your notes in the text box<br />
            4. Tap on the "X" to close the text box when you're complete<br />
            <br />
            You can also tap on an existing note and delete it.</p>
        <h4>
            <u>Share Your Notes</u>
        </h4>
        <p>
            You can tap on the Share button to share your notes. When you tap on the button,
            it will compose an email with a link to the map and the notes you've added to the
            map. When a user clicks on the link, they'll be asked to sign in to the Executive
            Dashboard before being able to review your notes.</p>
        <h4>
            <u>Settings</u>
        </h4>

            Dashboard News and Events. To enter a feed or trend, tap on the Settings button,
            then enter the feed or trend. Tap the Save button when you're finished.<br />
            <br />
            The Feeds and Trends you add to your Executive Dashboard are stored locally on the
            device and will be removed when you clear your device's local browser cache and
            storage.</p>

            indicators (KPIs) that decision-makers and senior management need to effectively

            as a starting point from which the executive can get a sense of the big picture
            before digging deeper into data.<br />
            <br /></p>
